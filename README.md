# Data Lake
## Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, I'm building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Description
Build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. By loading data from S3, processing the data into analytics tables using Spark, and loading them back into S3. This is will be obtained by deploying the Spark process on a cluster using AWS.



## Files:
1. `dl.cfg` configuration file that contains the AWS credentials.
2. `etl.py` the whole ETL process for loading the data till saving it in the Big Data Fomrat.
3. `Testing.ipynb` A notebook on the EMR cluster to test the ETL process. 


## Project Datasets
- Two datasets that reside in S3:
    - Song data: ``s3://udacity-dend/song_data``        
    - Log data: ``s3://udacity-dend/log_data``

- Log data json path: ``s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json``

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from  [the Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema:
**Star schema**
### Fact Table
1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
   - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
### Dimension Tables
2. **users** - users in the app
   - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
3. **songs** - songs in music database
   - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. **artists** - artists in music database
   - artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
5. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
   - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Project Steps
1. Create EMR Cluster that contains Spark and Hive on Hadoop.
2. Load the data from S3.
3. Use spark to create the tables according to the schema.
4. Saving the data as parquet files using the appropriate partitioning.
